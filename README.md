Keep track of time of possession for your favorite sports teams during games.

This app was originally developed by me and put in the App Store in January of 2016. Was a quick app I developed because the lacrosse coach I was collecting stats for kept asking me what our team's time of possession was and I had no idea. Was all built in Objective-C using storyboards. Tens of people used it over the almost 4 years it was available in the App Store! 

When I started to learn Swift and SwiftUI, I decided to completely re-write the app as one of my first little swift projects. It was fun and it's a useful app. 

**Version:** 2.0.0

**Language:** Swift

**Layout:** SwiftUI

**Known issues:** None

**Planned features:**
* Would certainly like a better looking UI.
